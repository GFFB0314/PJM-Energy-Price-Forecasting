This is a fantastic question. It hits the core of the difference between a "Notebook Data Scientist" and a 
"Full-Stack Data Scientist."

Why are we using SQL instead of just Pandas?

You are right—Pandas read_csv() is faster right now for this small 1MB file. But you are building a portfolio to
get hired. Here is why I (as a CDO) force my team to use SQL, and why you must do it here:

- Resume "Grit": Everyone knows pd.read_csv(). Showing you can spin up a Postgres instance, define a schema, 
  and ingest data proves you understand infrastructure. It checks the "Solid SQL" box on your technical 
  requirements list.
  
- The "RAM Trap": Real energy data isn't 1MB. If you downloaded all PJM nodes for 5 years, it would be 50GB+. 
  Pandas tries to load that entirely into RAM and crashes your laptop. SQL stores it on the hard drive and only  
  pulls the specific rows you ask for.

- Feature Engineering Logic: In the real world (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks), we don't pull raw data into 
  Python to clean it. We use SQL to clean it in the database and only pull the clean dataset into Python for 
  training. This is called ELT (Extract, Load, Transform).

- Persistence: If you close VS Code, your Pandas dataframe vanishes. A database keeps the data forever.

NB: The Rule of Thumb: Use SQL to get and clean the data. Use Pandas and Sklearn to analyze and model the data.
