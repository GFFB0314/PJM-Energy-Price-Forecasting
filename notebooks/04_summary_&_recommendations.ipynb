    "## <u>Executive Summary: Intelligent Energy Arbitrage Engine</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date:** January 2, 2026  \n",
    "**Project Lead:** Fares Fahim Bechir Gbetnkom<br>\n",
    "**Target:** PJM Western Hub (Real-Time Hourly Market)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)\n",
    "We successfully deployed a machine learning forecasting engine capable of identifying arbitrage opportunities in the PJM Western Hub energy market. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a simulated backtest on a **100 MWh battery asset** over the final two months of 2024, the model identified **$974,286 in realized revenue**, capturing **72.9%** of the total theoretical market opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Business Problem\n",
    "Energy price volatility at the Western Hub creates significant arbitrage opportunities (buying low, selling high). However, standard linear forecasting models fail to account for:\n",
    "*   **The \"Duck Curve\":** Solar radiation depressing midday prices.\n",
    "*   **Extreme Weather:** Non-linear price spikes caused by freezing conditions or heatwaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive strategies miss these spikes, leaving millions of dollars in potential revenue on the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The Solution Strategy\n",
    "We moved beyond basic statistical averages and built a **Physics-Aware Machine Learning Pipeline**:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Data Integration:** Merged PJM Grid Data with localized weather feeds (Harrisburg, PA proxy).\n",
    "*   **Feature Engineering:** Modeled the \"U-Shaped\" relationship between Temperature and Price using Polynomial Transformations.\n",
    "*   **Algorithmic Approach:** Utilized a **Gradient Boosting Regressor** (GBR) to capture discontinuous market logic (e.g., sudden price jumps due to congestion).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Financial Impact Analysis\n",
    "We simulated a standard **100 MWh Battery Asset** (1 Cycle per Day) operating blindly based on the model's signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Period:** Nov 1, 2024 – Dec 31, 2024 (Holdout Test Set)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Result | Meaning |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Total Market Potential** | **$1,337,379** | Profit if we had a crystal ball (Perfect Hindsight). |\n",
    "| **Realized Model Profit** | **$974,286** | Actual profit generated by the model's decisions. |\n",
    "| **Capture Efficiency** | **72.9%** | The model captured nearly 3/4 of all available profit. |\n",
    "| **Forecast Accuracy** | **$17.12 / MWh** | Average error (RMSE), outperforming baselines by ~15%. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Recommendation\n",
    "Based on the **72.9% Efficiency rating**, we recommend:\n",
    "1.  **Deploy to Shadow Mode:** Run the model against live January 2025 auctions to verify latency and data stability.\n",
    "2.  **Integrate Outage Data:** Future iterations should ingest Generator Outage reports to predict supply-side shocks.\n"
